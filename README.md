## Steps
This repository has two versions of the same activity - the original workshop for the older Twine 1.4 and an updated version for Twine 2.

For Twine version 2.0
<ol>
  <li>Follow the instructions on the worksheet: 
   [Twine2Worksheet.pdf](Library%20Adventure%20-%20instructions%20-%20Sept%2018.pdf)</li>
  <li>You can write down your own choice of story elements on a print out of [TwineHandoutSheet.pdf](TwineHandoutSheet.pdf) if you like.</li>
  </ol>
  
  For Twine version 1.4
<ol>
  <li>Download the Twine application (for Windows or Mac depending on your computer) from  <a href="twinery.org">twinery.org</a></li>
  <li>Install Twine from the downloaded file and open it when it's finished installing.</li>
  <li>Go to the file menu and open the file LibraryAdventure.tws that you downloaded</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions on the worksheet: TwineWorksheet.pdf</li>
  <li>You can write down your own choice of story elements on a print out of TwineHandoutSheet.pdf if you like.</li>
  </ol>
  
Unlike at an actual Dojo, we can't upload your story to our server, but there are a number of free sites that will host your Twine story once you've built it to produce an HTML file.  These include:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.philome.la/">philome.la</li>
    <li><a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities.org</li>
    <li><a href="http://adventurecow.com/">adventurecow.com</li>
  </ul>


## Note
Keep in mind that as with any creative tool,  whether it's text-, video-, or photo-based, not all the Twine stories on the web will be suitable for younger readers.
